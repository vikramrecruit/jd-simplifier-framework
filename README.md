# JD Simplifier Framework
A practical, non-technical framework to convert long job descriptions into recruiter-ready sourcing inputs.

## Why
- Save time for recruiters and hiring managers
- Align on must-have vs. nice-to-have skills
- Generate consistent, portal-ready Boolean strings

## What’s inside
- `templates/jd-breakdown-template.md` — One-pager to summarize any JD
- `checklists/jd-quality-checklist.md` — 15-point sanity check before sourcing
- `examples/` — 3 filled samples (Java, Data Analyst, QA) with Boolean for LinkedIn/Naukri/Monster
- `booleans/portal-boolean-guidelines.md` — Operator rules per portal

## How to use (5 minutes)
1. Paste the JD into `templates/jd-breakdown-template.md`.
2. Fill sections: Summary (2–3 lines), Mandatory, Secondary, Responsibilities.
3. Generate Boolean using the guide, then copy to job portals.
4. Share the one-pager with your team/stakeholder.
